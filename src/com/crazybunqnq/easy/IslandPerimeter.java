/**
 * You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1
 * represents land and 0 represents water. Grid cells are connected
 * horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded
 * by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land
 * cells). The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to
 * the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The
 * grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the
 * perimeter of the island.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * [[0,1,0,0],
 * [1,1,1,0],
 * [0,1,0,0],
 * [1,1,0,0]]
 * 
 * Answer: 16
